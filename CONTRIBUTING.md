# How to Contribute
## Thank You
Thank you for considering contributing to GoVote. Collectively we hope we can make GoVote a great produce and tool to help digitise some of our democratic processes.

Since global pandemic we have had to rapidly adopt new digital ways of works across all areas of business. We hope people find GoVote a useful tool for now and the future.

## Your contributions.
Any contribution is welcome. Govote is an Beta product and with help and support from the community we hope it can be developed further and in to a product that suits the needs of many.

Although in Beta, Newcastle City Council has successfully used Go Vote during their council meetings, allowing council members to case their vote during meetings using their chosen web enabled device.  It saved the council from a potential large bill in replacing their ageing physical voting system in their council chambers by adopt a low-cost digital solution.

Originally trialled and used by Newcastle City Council when physical council meetings were help, Go Vote now being successfully used during the Council virtual meetings.

You can see an example of GoVote being used in a virtual council meeting for Newcastle city council on the 24th of June 2020[ here](https://youtu.be/-UxsgA4PDWU?t=1000 " here")

The hope is through community contributions like yours many other organisations can benefit from using GoVote.

Some of the areas we have thought about developing future are:

-	GUI improvements (Inc navigation for admins)
-	Ability to load custom seating plans/layouts
-	User guides and Development guides

These are just three areas we have though about for improvements and are hoping the community can help build these about and contribute to more.  Any improvement in any area is welcome. 

## Ground Rules
**Yours and our behaviour.**

When communicating with others please be respectful and considerate. We hope GoVote can be a collaborative project for anyone to work on. Please take technical responsibilities when submitting any code and remember the importance of testing and the project dependencies. We ask that everyone follow the Contributor Covent code of conduct found [here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/ "here").

The project team current has limited capacity but will endeavour to respond any queries ASAP, but please be practice with us.

*Responsibilities*

- 	Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted.
- 	Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- 	Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
- 	Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- 	Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

As a community please help people who are new to our project understand where they can be most helpful.

## Your First Contribution
We are new to open source projects too, so please be patient and kind ðŸ˜Š

**Below are some resource for people who have never contributed to open source before.**

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github "How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub").

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first ðŸ˜Š

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

## Getting started
For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1.	Create your own fork of the code
2.	Do the changes in your fork
3.	If you like the change and think the project could use it: * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA* Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

- 	Spelling / grammar fixes
- 	Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
- 	Comment clean up
- 	Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
- 	Adding logging messages or debugging output
- 	Changes to â€˜metadataâ€™ files 
- 	Moving source files from one directory or package to another

## How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Please email <Opensourceprojects@newcastle.gov.uk> instead.

 In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

- 	Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
- 	Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at <Opensourceprojects@newcastle.gov.uk>

**Bug report.**

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1.	What version of GoVote are you using?
2.	What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3.	What did you do?
4.	What did you expect to see?
5.	What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in GoVote, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs.  Please open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

Hopefully we and the community can pick this up to work upon.

## Code review process

**How a contribution gets accepted after itâ€™s been submitted.**

The core team will aim to look at Pull Requests on a regular basis (ideally weekly but this could be up to 2 weeks). If a request is not accepted, we will aim to provide feedback. Once feedback is given, we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
